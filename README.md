Wander is an Arweave and AO native wallet that provides non-custodial wallet and asset management. Wander allows wallet holders to interact with any Arweave or AO dApps without sharing the user needing to share private keys with the dApp.

The isolated environment that Wander creates is not only a security improvement for users, but it also provides a more seamless login flow for applications. Developers no longer have to build sign in functionality, they can let Wander do the hard work for them.
