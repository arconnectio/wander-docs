The Wander devtools allows you to easily connect your application to Wander and manage its settings.

## Connect

Upon startup, you'll be able to connect your app. You can select what permissions you want to allow the app to have. Once you selected the permissions you want, click _Force Connect_.

## Manage your app

The following settings are available at a glance for your app:

* Permissions\
  Manage permissions for your application quickly.
* Allowance\
  Manage spending allowance for your app
* Gateway\
  Select from suggested gateways or enter a custom one
*   Bundler node\
    Set the bundler node your app uses when calling [`dispatch()`](../api/dispatch.md) .

    Turbo is the default bundler node
